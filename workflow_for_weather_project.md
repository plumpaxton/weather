Repeatable processes can help to make team projects flow smoothly and move towards a finished product. At the beginning of each project we will discuss how that specific team would like to accomplish the work and then set up a workflow for each member.

The following workflows will help each member know what is expected of them throughout the project.

General File Additions:

Npaxton - Submit new files to npaxton branch
NavPaxton - Submit new files to navpaxton branch
Dpaxton - Submit new files to dpaxton branch
PlumPaxton - Make the final decision on merge requests from individual branches to the master branch.

Adding Code:

All members submit new versions of code to the Dev Branch. PlumPaxton will review and merge new versions of the code to the master branch.
