Localized Weather Research Project

Overview of Project:
When we watch the weather forecast, we are given an average temperature, humidity, allergy index, and other indicators for our areas. This is typically pretty accurate, but for people that garden or people with lot of allergies or sensitivities, a more accurate indicator would be helpful. In this project, we will investigate the differences in localized weather conditions and how they affect allergies and plant life.
 
Main Research Question:
Are the differences in measured local weather significant from forecast weather?
